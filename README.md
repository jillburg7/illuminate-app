# Illuminate

### Purpose
A prototype web application intended to enhance the multiple-student/instructor learning experience by providing an interactive virtual environment for course lecture content and Q&A activities. Designed using responsive web design techniques such that any user with a device with a reliable network connection may use the application.

#### State of Development
